Sprites:
Baby
House plan (top-down view of a relatively simple house)

Priorities:
Baby sprite + baby actions development
House sprite + interactions development
Hunger + mood meter for baby sprites and development
A way to represent time in-game

TBD- Budget? How?
Most difficult parts of raising an IRL child that NEED to be in the game:
1. Random sleep deprivation - baby wakes up at random times and cries each night                             
2. Random cries - baby has a different cry for each situation, e.g. tired, hungry, dirty diaper
3. Random diaper changes
